To initiate the database you must run the ``prisma generate`` command with your package manager (such as NPM or PNPM).

You can run the ``dev`` command to run the aplication in development mode or run the ``build`` and ``start`` commands to run the application in production mode.

You can run the ``prisma db seed`` command to seed the database with random data and test the application.
